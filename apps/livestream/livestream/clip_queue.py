"""The clip queues: what a session holds, in order, at each stage.

A clip passes three stages: enqueued (waiting in the **generation queue**),
built (waiting in the **playout queue**), and consumed (playing removed it).
Both queues are instances of one positional container, :class:`ClipQueue` —
bounded, ordered, with insert-at-position and move — and ``fasth3.py`` owns
when entries cross between them (a finished build leaves generation and joins
the playout tail).

Pure bookkeeping — no torch, no fastvideo, no runtime imports — so queue
behaviour is testable on any machine. `ClipInfo` in ``fasth3_types.py`` is
the wire form every mention of a clip carries; ``ClipEntry.snapshot()`` here
is its single producer.
