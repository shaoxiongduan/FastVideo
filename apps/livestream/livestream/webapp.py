"""The watch page: video on the left, live chat and queue on the right.

Everything the panel shows is folded from the engine's own message stream --
the mirror registers with `Engine.add_listener` and rebuilds itself from
`state_update`, `queue_update` and the `clip_*` messages -- so this module
holds no state of its own that could drift out of step.

One HTTP origin serves the page, the HLS segments, the state websocket and the
chat endpoint, because a tunnel proxies one port: publishing the whole demo is
pointing `cloudflared` at this server and nothing else.

Routes:
    GET  /              the page
    GET  /assets/<file> the logo and favicon it references
    GET  /hls/<file>    the playlist and segments (written by `sink.py`)
    GET  /healthz       whether the engine is loaded
    WS   /state         one JSON snapshot on connect, then one per change
    POST /chat          {"author": str, "text": str} -> a prompt for the director
