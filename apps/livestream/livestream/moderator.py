"""Moderation for viewer prompts, via the OpenAI moderations API.

Runs on its own endpoint and key (`MODERATION_*` in the environment), falling
back to the upsampling credentials when unset — because the two are often
*not* the same service: an OpenAI-compatible inference gateway typically does
not expose `/moderations` (Reactor's corp gateway answers it with
`provider_not_allowed`), so moderation usually points at api.openai.com while
upsampling goes through the gateway.

Policy decisions, deliberate:
  * Only the viewer's raw prompt is checked, and this is the **only** safety
    gate: the upsampler deliberately stages ideas faithfully rather than
    softening them, so what passes here is what gets rendered. Idle-filler
    prompts are a curated list in this repo and skip the check.
  * Errors **fail closed**: a prompt that cannot be checked is rejected. A
    silent fail-open would quietly turn moderation off exactly when the
    endpoint misbehaves. If the stream must keep accepting prompts without a
    working moderation endpoint, disable moderation explicitly
    (`MODERATION_ENABLED=0`) — that state is then visible in the startup log
    instead of hidden in per-prompt errors.
