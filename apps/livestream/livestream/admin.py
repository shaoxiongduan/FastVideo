"""Admin chat commands: live control of the stream from trusted chatters.

Admins are the chat usernames listed in `ADMIN_USERS` (comma-separated,
matched case-insensitively). A bare entry (`name`) matches that username on
any platform; a scoped entry (`twitch:name`, `youtube:name`) matches it on
one — use scoping when the same display name could be different people on
different platforms.

Admin commands ride the same chat sources as viewer prompts. The router in
`main.py` hands every matched command here first, before the director sees
it, so an admin command never costs a cooldown slot, a moderation call, or
an LLM call — and a `!prompt` from an admin is still just a prompt. A
recognized admin command from a non-admin is consumed and logged, never
treated as a prompt.

The command set:

  * `!switch <preset>` — swap the creative preset live. The name is resolved
    against the `presets/` folder at that moment, so dropping a new JSON
    into the folder makes it switchable with no restart. The upsampler's
    style and the idle filler's prompt list change immediately, and both
    model queues are flushed down to one buffer clip
    (`Director.flush_stale_clips`) so the new identity reaches the stream in
    about one clip's time instead of draining a whole queue of old-style
    clips.
