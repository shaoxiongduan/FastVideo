"""Whether a viewer's prompt survives, and whether they are told when it does not.

This path had no tests, which is how a silent drop reached a live stream: the
web app answers the POST with `ok` and echoes the prompt into chat, then the
director -- downstream of that acknowledgement -- can still refuse it. Anything
that refuses here has to report back, or the viewer watches their request
appear and then vanish.

No GPU, no network: the engine, upsampler and moderator are stubs, because what
is under test is the admission decision, not what happens after it.
